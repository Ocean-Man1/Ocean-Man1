#DAY 4 CHALLENGE
#This challenge involves recieving an input and determing where to mark an 'X' on the grid, following the logic of marking treasure on a map


line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇

letter = position[0].lower()    #create a uniform input
abc = ["a", "b", "c"]      #create reference list for indexing
letter_index = abc.index(letter)   #compare input to list and find index

num_index = int(position[1]) - 1    #account for indexing

map[num_index][letter_index] = 'X'
  
# Write your code above this row 👆
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
